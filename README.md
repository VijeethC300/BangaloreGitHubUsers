# Scraping of GitHub users using GitHub API and Data Analysis (Bangalore)
## Description

* Data Scraping: Data was scraped using Python code run on GoogleColab. GitHub token was used.
* The most interesting and surprising facts:
    a) Out of 593 users, 28 users [4.7% ]are of Organization/Group Type eg Zerodha. Rest are Individual users [95.3%]
    b) Though Pascal Language has the highest average number of stars per repository, it was used in only One repository [0.002% repo share]
    c) Most of the repositories we created by users on a Monday [15.4%], followed by Tuesday [15%]. However the least repositories were created by users on Sunday [12.9%] This means maximum variation across the days on which repositories were created is less [~2.5%]. So, kind of almost a uniform distribution across all the day.
